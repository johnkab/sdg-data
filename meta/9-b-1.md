  The manufacture of medical and dental instruments and supplies (ISIC4 325) have been excluded from the figures due to the small size of 325 meaning that it is not available as a specific breakdown. This indicator is being used as an approximation of the UN SDG Indicator. Where possible,
  we will work to identify or develop UK data to meet the global indicator specification. This indicator has been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
