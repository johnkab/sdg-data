**Non-statistical indicator**

The UK meets/fully meets target 10.7 with well managed migration policies in place and has scored 97% based on the UN proposed methodology for reporting this indicator. This is based on 6 domains (with the UK score for each domain included in parenthesis) - Migrant rights (80%); Whole of Government/Evidence-based policies (100%); Cooperation and partnerships (100%); Socioeconomic wellbeing (100%); Mobility dimensions of crises (100%); Safe, orderly and regular migration (100%). The [Home Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office) is responsible for implementing migration policies in the UK, and have identified various policies relevant to this indicator against the 6 policy domains. For example:
 
* Migrant rights - Information is available on migrants' rights to [essential and/or emergency health care services](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nhs-visitor-and-migrant-cost-recovery-programme) and [public funds](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-funds--2/public-funds).
* Whole of Government/Evidence-based policies - In December 2018, the Government published a [White paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-future-skills-based-immigration-system) setting out its strategy for the future skills-based immigration system. Following consultation on the Government’s [Integrated Communities Strategy Green Paper](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/696993/Integrated_Communities_Strategy.pdf), the Government published its [Integrated Communities Action Plan](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/778045/Integrated_Communities_Strategy_Govt_Action_Plan.pdf) in February 2019. This sets out the action across Government to address the key causes of poor integration and to deliver the Government’s vision for integrated communities.
* Cooperation and partnerships - The UK has entered into a large number of UK - third country cooperation arrangements. These relationships are governed in a number of ways - through formal and informal cooperation and collaboration, dialogues, Memoranda of Understanding, regulatory arrangements, and in some cases through international agreements and treaties. For example, the UK maintains a strong bilateral relationship with France on tackling illegal migration. In January 2018, both countries signed the Sandhurst Treaty, under which they agreed to adopt a ‘whole of route’ approach to tackle illegal migration and to reduce migratory pressures at our shared border. The Government also consults civil society and the private sector directly on key policy changes. 
* Socioeconomic wellbeing - The Government commissions the independent [Migration Advisory Committee (MAC)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/migration-advisory-committee) to advise the Government on the effects of migration upon the labour market, for example occupations that are subject to labour shortages. The MAC provide transparent, independent and evidence-based advice to the government on immigration issues. 
* Mobility dimensions of crises - The UK has a proud history of providing protection to those who need it, in accordance with our international obligations under the Refugee Convention and European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). 
* Safe, orderly and regular migration -  Since April 2015, the Home Office has collected Exit Checks data on passengers leaving the UK. This data provides a comprehensive picture of whether those who enter the UK leave when they are supposed to and helps target interventions towards those who have overstayed their visas and are in the UK illegally. It is also used to improve the UK's ability to identify and further tighten the immigration routes and visas that are most vulnerable to abuse. The 2018 [Serious and Organised Crime (SOC) Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/serious-and-organised-crime-strategy-2018) sets out how the Government will mobilise the full force of the state and align our collective efforts to tackle serious and organised crime. This includes tackling Organised Immigration Crime, Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking and maximising our ability to intervene upstream and at our borders.

This indicator was reviewed in 2019 and will next be reviewed in 2021.
